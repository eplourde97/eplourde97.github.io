<div>
Q: What is your favorite color?
</div>
A: Depending on my mood, you will get three different answers for this. You will either get blue or red. This is just due to whatever mood I'm in. 
If I'm in a good mood, it will most definitely be blue. If I'm angry (during a tennis match is the best time), red will be my go to.

<p>
<div>
Q: What is your favorite sport?
</div>
A: Tennis. Played it my whole life. I enjoy the challenge of taking on someone else in a 1v1 match up. No one can help you; it's only you and and your opponent. 
It's a very unique adrenaline rush.
</p>

<div>
Q: What is your favorite season?
</div>
A: So long as there is snow, Winter will always be my favorite season. It's always so pretty with snow on the trees and such. 
I rather enjoy the cold, even if it's twenty or thirty below out. It makes it that much more challenging to survive outside. 
Snowmobiling is also my number one hobby, so I always embrace winter with open arms. If there was no snow, I would have to say Fall would be my favorite season due 
to the changing of color of the leaves and the temperature dropping.
</p>

<div>
Q: If you could live anywhere, where would you live?
</div>
A: Easy: my parents' home. Beautiful countryside and endless fields are all I need.
</p>

<p>
<div>
Q: What is your favorite TV show? 
</div>
A: Without a doubt, Star Trek makes number one on this list. It would be illogical to think otherwise. 
My favorite series being either The Next Generation or Voyager. I love how The Next Generation brings up so many moral and philosophical issues, as well as showing
Patrick Stewart as the captain of the Enterprise. However, Voyager has such a well written story with it starting in the Delta Quadrant and ending with them returning
home. I have to give Dragon Ball Z an honorable mention, though, as it is my second favorite show to watch. Kids show or not, it's pretty epic.
</p>

<p>
<div>
Q: Who do you look up to as a role model?
</div>
A: Jesus is my homie for sure. However, for a human role model that doesn't have the luxery of omnipitence, I would have to say my father and my grandfather. 
I'm not going to get into details as I could write a ten page paper on the matter.
</p>

<p>
<div>
Q: What is your favorite video game?
</div>
A: That's a tough one. I would have to say my overall favorite would be Battlefield 3. I played this with one of my buddies from high school for years on the XBox 360. 
My favorite as of last year, though, is definitely Rocket League. You can see some clips in the link named Rocket League. 
An honorable mention would definitely be Minecraft. Although it is highly a kids game, it's basically digital legos for me. It was my go-to game for relaxation.
</p>

<p>
<div>
Q: If you could have any superpower, what would it be?
</div>
A: If you have ever seen Dragon Ball Z, you would know that a lot of the power that the character display are due to their ability to control Chi (Ki). 
With that, they can move extremely fast (even teleport with the right technique), super strength, and the ability to fly. 
Not that I would be able to fight like the characters in the show could, but it would still be pretty cool to have something like Ki control.
</p>

<div>
Q: What is your definition of perfection?
</div>
A: Wow, on to the hard questions, huh? Well, we're only human, so we can't be truly perfect. Although, that doesn't mean we can't be perfect in our own way. 
For me, perfection is never letting anyone else down. If you can look at them in the eye and tell them, without a doubt in your mind and with complete honesty, 
that you did everything in your power to succeed at whatever it was that you were tasked to do, then you're perfect. 
</p>

<p>
<div>
Q: Last question: What is your favorite genre of music?
</div>
A: Well, I don't really have one to be honest. I like everything except for pop and most hip-hop. Other than that, I can listen to just about anything.
Right now, for instance, I'm listening to Bulletproof by Breakdown of Sanity. I usually like listening to them while I work because it keeps my adrenaline 
up and I can't understand 90% of what they're saying because it's just them screaming, which means I can't sing along. However, I could just as easily go listen to 
classical music, opera, jazz, country, alternative rock, movie soundtracks, or dubstep. It doesn't make a difference to me what it is.
